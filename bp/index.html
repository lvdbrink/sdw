          <h3>Linking Data</h3>
          <p>linking between things at the dataset level is largely covered by DWBP. Put reference here. </p>
          <p>make the links within the dataset discoverable</p>
          <p>it's useful to have hyperlinks to things like Geonames, wikipedia, OSM etc (see list on the mailiing list, keyword: stamp collecting)</p>
          <p>making links between entities in the dataset discoverable and crawlable. Using linksets are one example of doing that at the dataset level, a third party making collections of links browsable and allowing discovery of backlinks.  Note that this is an emerging practice, not an established one.  Also address here: how do you deal with maintaining links over time (when resources you link to may change or disappear). Example: OpenPHACTS. </p>
          <p class="issue">This needs further discussion. Linksets does not seem to be an evidence-based best practice. It might be an emerging practice; CSIRO example. This might go in a shared note with the DWBP. </p>
          <p>how to publish your semantics if you're using XML / GML</p>
          <p>put reference here to LDBP: http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/ Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data (includes info on publishing vocabularies)</p>
          <p>research paper on using PROV to distinguish between world views is at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13326-015-0008-2/fulltext.html</p>
          <p>about representations changing over time: administrative boundaries and catchment datasets as examples of how you shouldn't create new objects when for some reason the records change while the real world thing stays the same. Dataset owners need to be aware of this.</p>
          <p>(here or in a different section) A list/matrix of the common formats (GeoJSON, GML, RDF, JSON-LD) and what you can or can't achieve with it.</p>
          <p class="note">Possible gap in best practice and something we might recommend (as a recommended way) even though we don't label it a best practice: we may need to come up with a new sameAs which is a spatial:samePlaceAs. If we feel that the lack of that expression is impeding getting spatial data on the web. Not meaning spatial intersection, but the social notion of different communities or people talking about a place and meaning the same place. 'placial instead of spatial view'. </p>

        <section class="bp-clear-semantics">
          <h3>Publishing data with clear semantics</h3>
          <p>The primary use case for this is you already have a database of assets and you want to publish the semantics of this data. Another use case is someone wanting to publish some information wich has a spatial component on the web in a form that search engines will understand. </p>
          <h4>Thematic semantics</h4>
          <p>This document will give some pointers on how to publish the general semantics of spatial things and their properties in a LD context. E.g. predicates have URIs and you can look those up to see what they mean). Refer to DWBP BP #4 Provide structural metadata. </p>
          <p class="example">fire car example</p>
          
          <h4>Spatial semantics</h4>
          <p>Examples of spatial semantics are relationship types like nearby, contains, etc. This best practice will list the geometric, topological and social spatial relationships. </p>
          <p class="issue">Which vocabularies out there have social spatial relationships? FOAF, GeoNames, ... </p>

        <section class="bp-exposing-via-api">
          <h3>Exposing datasets through APIs</h3>
          <p>using an API that supports content negotiation when necessary.</p>
          <p>the URL for accessing a dataset does not equal a persistent identifier for the dataset itself.</p>
          <p>There's no best practice for exposing Web Feature Service content in a more accessible way from a linked data point of view. However we describe here a recommended way of doing it, giving each feature its own stable URI and extending the API to make it more discoverable.  </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="bp-discovery">
          <h3>Enabling discovery</h3>
          <p>One way of discovering is browsing through data using semantics; which allows you to find related data through semantic similarity.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="bp-identifiers">
          <h3>Assigning identifiers to real world things and information resources</h3>
          <p>Mostly, people looking for information are interested in real world things, not in information records. </p>
          <p>Real world things vs features: Lighthouse example goes here (insert whiteboard picture here); real world thing, feature is information record about the thing, but often in current practice has properties that are about the real thing and properties about the information record. The features are in a dataset, the dataset has an id and the features have a local id. So currently you cannot link to them; the features need to have http URI identifiers instead. </p>
          <p>Examples: CSIRO spatial identifier reference framework; http://almere.pilod.nl/bgtld/v2; ...</p>
          <p>tell people what to do if they've got feature data and publish that in a linked data way. First see if there's an authoritative URI already that you can link to and if so do that; else how to mint the identifier yourself based on the features in your dataset and how the identifier is for the real world thing the feature describes. Local names are not typically URIs. We know we want to use URIs as identifiers. So we might take the dataset URI - which identifies a silo
          ... think of a different dataset, this one about shiprecks near lighthouses. But problem is mapping the local IDs, we want to be able to express the linkages within the dataset
          </p>
          <p>add reference to DWBP BP 11 (once phila gets this addition approved by the wg).</p>
          
          <p>Using sameAs to establish that two resources are about the same thing. These sameAs statements could be collected into one set and this set could have provenance so that you can see who created the sameAs statements and decide if you'd trust them. </p>
          <p class="note">There's an owl:sameAs as well as schema.org/sameAs. The latter is less strong. </p>
          <p class="issue">this part could fit into the Linking data section instead of the identification section</p>
          <p>datasets need to be identified</p>
          <p>features (things) need to be identified</p>
          <p>representations (geometry, topology) should be identified and must be if they are managed elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Identifiers should be URLs (http URIs) and must be globally unique.</p>
          <p>in order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves (bottom up, like hashtags) and this BP will give some pointers about how to create good URIs (should be dereferenceable/resolvable). There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist.</p>
          <p>There are many mechanisms to reconcile (i.e. map/link) objects from different datasets. You can use spatial correlation, but this is often not enough. There is also danger in doing so. Then there's the question of using sameAs or e.g. skos mapping relations like skos:related etc. </p>

            <p>choosing the right format.</p>
            <p>You should return useful information when a resource is referenced. What is useful? We will explain this in more detail. This could also fit in the Enabling discovery section. Make each resource available as a URL, e.g. http://maps.nanaimo.ca/data/property/</p>
            <p>Spatial things could also be identified with one or more names. These could be toponyms (names that appear on a map) or colloquial names (that local people use for a place). This part will explain how you provide the names / labels for the spatial things you are referring to. (a way to do this could be rdfs:label)</p>
            <p>Fuzzyness of spatial data: it is often in social discourse useful to identify spatial things even though they're fuzzy. E.g. Renaissance Italy or the American West. </p>
            <p class="issue">Do we need a subclass of SpatialThing or a property that expresses the fuzzyness of a spatial thing.</p>
            <p>Spatial things can change over time. The data on the web best practice #8 addresses the topic of versioning things. Include reference here. </p>
            <p class="example">An example of a versioned spatial thing goes here.</p>
            <p>There are different vocabularies about spatial things available. This section will have information about when to use which vocabulary.
